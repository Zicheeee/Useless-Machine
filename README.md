Tools:
MISC Screws, M2.5 x 0.45 or M3 x 0.5 (probably)
Super Glue

How To:
Step 1: Print all of the key parts on the thingiverse page. (Body, Top, Lid, Arm, One of the arm heads)
Step 2: Solder a Male to Female Dupont cable to a 1k resistor.
Step 3: Solder a Male to Female Dupont cable and the other end of the 1k resistor to the middle leg of the SPST toggle switch.
Step 4: Solder a Male to Female Dupont cable to the outer leg of the SPST toggle switch.
Step 5: Assemble the top of the box by putting the SPST toggle switch in the hole and using the nut included.
Step 6: Load the code onto the ESP or Arduino and follow the circuit diagram to build the circuit.
Step 7: Make sure the servo is in the right orientation by powering on the ESP or Arduino and flicking the switch, make sure the servo is in the off position when the switch is off.
Step 8: Screw the MG90S into the slot.
Step 9: Apply Super Glue to the inside of the arm and install the arm onto the MG90S servo, making sure the arm is in the right orientation.
Step 10: Check everything works, then glue the head of the arm on by powering down the circuit while the arm is up, maybe inverse the code for the arm to be up when the switch is off, Then glue the head onto the body with the head pressed up against the switch.
Step 11: Power up the circuit and check everything works.
Step 12: Screw in the lid.
Step 13: Either apply some double sided tape to the top of the ESP or Arduino and stick it in the box, or just sit it in the box.
Step 14: Profit.
